# TdUx

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.4.

TdUX is my submission for the Teradata UX project, developed with Angular 5 + Teradata's Covalent.

The main application consists of an Analyst and Consumer page, which can be toggled in the side-nav bar.

# Analyst

Main difference between the consumer page is the addition of a form, potentially used as an "Article Submitter" Form has a wizard-like stepper to ensure user inputs all the correct fields

# Consumer

Page with the same data, just a different color and no additional buttons. Meant for a "View-Only" experience.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
